(also known as SMP Mod or Multiplayer Commands Mod)
~!~!~!~!~
This mod acts as a server-side plugin, clients connecting to the server do not need to install this to access its functionality!

Version 1.0:

- Added three new player-to-player teleportation commands: /tpa [playername], /tpaccept [playername], and /tpcancel
    > These can be used without op permissions, allowing players to manage their own teleports without needing to call an admin

- Added a new config file, SMPMod.properties, that lets server hosts disable the tpa commands
